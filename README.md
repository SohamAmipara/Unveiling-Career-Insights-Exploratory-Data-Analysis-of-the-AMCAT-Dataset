# Unveiling Career Insights: Exploratory Data Analysis of the AMCAT Dataset

Welcome to the project repository for "Unveiling Career Insights: Exploratory Data Analysis of the AMCAT Dataset"! In this project, we delve into the world of data exploration and analysis to uncover valuable insights about career trends and factors influencing salaries.

## Overview
The AMCAT dataset provides a rich source of information about candidates' academic background, skills, and employment details. Our goal in this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of this dataset and extract actionable insights.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading:** We start by loading the dataset and understanding its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and statistical tests, we explore various aspects of the dataset such as salary distributions, trends over years of experience, and the impact of education on salary.
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** We analyze the relationships between different variables to uncover interesting patterns.
4. **Additional Visualization/EDA Steps:** Further exploration including time-series analysis, clustering, feature importance, outlier detection, and machine learning models.
5. **Conclusion:** Summarizing the findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Repository Structure
- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks detailing the EDA process and analysis steps.
- **Data:** Stores the AMCAT dataset used for analysis.
- **Images:** Holds images of visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **README.md:** You're reading it right now! This file provides an overview of the project.
